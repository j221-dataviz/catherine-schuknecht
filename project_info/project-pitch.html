<p>Over the past few months, billboards embellished with do-or-die religious messaging have been popping up all over the Bay Area. If you dial the <code>855-FOR-TRUTH</code> number listed at the bottom of the ads, one of the Christian Aid Ministries’ few dozen call center operators will be on-call to discuss your faith.</p>

<p>But, for a price. According to the Amish-Mennonite non-profit’s <a href="http://christianaidministries.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015-Financial-Statement.pdf">annual financial report</a>, it spent over $3 million on “billboard evangelism” in 2015 — up 400 percent since 2010.</p>
<p>My questions are: why the Bay Area and why now? One local news report suggested that the non-profit targets densley populated cities where people seem to be “walking away from God and truth.” But I’m interested in a more data-driven answer.</p>
<p>I intend to look at county-level census data (from <a href="http://crcc.usc.edu/california-religious-demographics/">here</a> or <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/religious-tradition/evangelical-protestant/">here</a>) showing religious identification in California, and produce a map showing which counties have the highest concentration of self-identified evangelists, overlaid with a map identifying evangelist billboard locations across the state. Doing so could highlight the discrepancy between the appearance of an evangelical presence in the state and the actual numbers of practitioners. Producing a map could also answer questions about which populations are being targeted by the billboards, and how much the non-profit is spending on road-side advertising in different counties. Of course, doing so would require requesting data from Christian Aid Ministries on the longitude and latitude coordinates of each of their California billboards. I’m optimistic that the non-profit would be willing to share this information because they maintain a seemingly incomplete map of their billboard locations across the United States at <a href="http://gospelbillboards.org/category/billboards/">Gospelbillboards.org</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve also read that a significant amount of the billboard space used by Christian Aid Ministries is actually donated by billboard companies. It could be interesting to see if the Outdoor Advertising Association of America – the trade organization that represents the country’s billboard owners and operators – has data on which companies donated space to the evangelical non-profit. This information could be presented in a bar chart, or incorporated into the original map.</p>
